    <p> So initially, I had no idea what I wanted to be when I grew up, then again what Highschooler really knows what they want
        to do</p>

    <p> so I thought.... why not be a Doctor?</p>
    <br>

    <p>So to get my feet wet, the summer before my freshman year of college, I decided to become an EMT</p>
    <br>

    <br>
    <p> This allowed me to get a degree in Biology from USF, as well as some real world experience!</p>
    <br>

    <br>
    <p>However, after graduation, Life had very different plans for me - So I took the next natural progression when having
        a Degree in Biology</p>
    <h1> <em><b>ACTING!!!</b></em></h1>

    <br>
    <img src="images/overdue.jpg" alt="over due bills">
    <br>
    <p>and The idea of being a starving artist, did not agree with my appitite<br> Plus, I was starting to hanging out with
        the wrong Crowd<br>
        <br>
        <img src="images/badcrowd.jpg" alt="3 guys dressed up in dark sunglasses, and a girl sneaking into the picture from behing">
