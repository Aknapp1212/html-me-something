        <p> So initially, I had no idea what I wanted to be when I grew up, then again what Highschooler really knows what they want to do</p>

        <p> so I thought.... why not be a Doctor?</p>
        	<img src ="images/Doctor.jpg" alt="Doctor and Xray">
        <p>So to get my feet wet, the summer before my freshman year of college, I decided to become an EMT</p>

        <p> This allowed me to get a degree in Biology from USF, as well as some real world experience!</p>
        	<img src ="images/usf.jpg" alt = "Entrance of University of South Florida" >
        <p>However, after graduation, Life had very different plans for me - So I took the next natural progression when having a Degree in Biology</p>
